Casey received a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and then a Master's in Applied Economics from UNC Greensboro. He decided to further his education by pursuing a PhD in Statistics from Ohio State University where he focused on Bayesian methods. He has spent his professional life working in the PK/PD world at Merck, Amgen, and Gilead spending a lot of time learning pharmacology and drug development while researching and advancing new tools and methods, particularly of the Bayesian variety, for implementation in the pharmacometrics space. He likes to play soccer, work out, go on random excursions with his dog, and go to punk, hardcore, and hip-hop shows. When he puts his shoes and socks on, he goes sock, sock, shoe, shoe.
